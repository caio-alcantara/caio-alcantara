Hi 👋

My name is Caio de Alcantara Santos

Im a 16 years old student from Brazil

So, currently I already learned the basics of Python 🐍, and am now learing Web Development 🕸️;
Currently focusing on HTML5 and CSS3, but I hope to be soon working with JavaScript and some framework (I've never used one, but I already show some affection for react u.u)
